You must implement DynamicPlaylist container wrapper that behaves like a tracks queue.
Playback should start from the first passed file (sequence is passed to constructor)
Track switch will remove current song from playlist
You can play a new song, while playlist won't be changed until explicit switch
You can set track to be played next, and also add track to the end of queue

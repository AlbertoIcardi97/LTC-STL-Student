## Common
* This training is quite big, and it will be hard to understand if there will be more than 3 hours per day.  
The best way is: 3 sessinons during week, 2.5 hours each.  
You can separate it in two parts: 2 weeks of training - first part, than skip 2 weeks, 2 weeks of training - second part.
* Ask your training manager permission to record the training, and give the records only for students that have solved practice tasks related (it is a good motivation)
* After each day of the training, don't forget to send the material to students.  
**CONVERT IT TO PDF BEFORE SENDING!**
* Fork this repo and don't forget to check for updates.

## Practice tasks and review
* **ALL practice tasks must be reviewed**
* Follow workflow and ask students to follow it: [workflow](https://github.com/smay1613/LTC-STL-Student#workflow)
* You can check most common review problems during review in closed pull requests list: [pulls](https://github.com/smay1613/LTC-STL-Student/pulls)
* If you have no time for practice, you can skip the task and give it as a homework
* Time for practice should not be the complete time for solving: it is a time for questions and attempts to solve
* Don't give a deadlines: student can solve any task at any time, even after a training
* Review only 2 times, and don't forget to mark pull request with "1st review" and "2nd review" label
* If everything in practice task looks good to you, assign "nice work" to the pull request
* You can introduce 3 types of review comment:
  - Critical (marked with bold font) - when you see something disastrous (like UB/crash/compilation error/etc)
  - Common - when you see something not optimal or incorrect (like excessive copy/incorrect use of algorithm/etc)
  - Non-critical (marked with italic font) - when you see something related to codestyle (bad naming/too big function/etc)
* **TEACH STUDENTS CPP CORE GUIDELINES (!!!!)**: [best practices](https://github.com/smay1613/LTC-STL-Student#best-practices-and-codestyle)  
Don't forget to link cpp core guidelines item when you are reviewing their code. 
**MODERN C++ STYLE IS VERY IMPORTANT PART OF THIS TRAINING.**
* **"Solved" repo may be out of date**, so you should check only the main idea of implementation there

## Before the training
* Ask students to fill the form like [that](https://forms.gle/J58TbwA2AQJjbF8T8)
It contains following questions:
  - Current position
  - Expectations
  - Area of C++ application
  - Current level of STL knowledge
* Motivate students to fill it: if 70% of students filled this form, send them examples as a separate projects

## After the training
* Ask students to fill the feedback in LTC or your form (like [that](https://forms.gle/ZPiQAHt9AghGLW8t6))  
If 50% of students have filled the feedback form, you should send solved practice tasks - it is quite a good motivation.

## Think-times
* You can find possible answers to "think-times" in slide note, or you can give example from your experience
* Give at least 1 minute for each think-time before discussion starts

## Quizes (optional)
* If you have time, give quizes for students with following rules:
  - Up to 5 people can join the quiz
  - Question is assigned only for one participiant
  - There is only 60 seconds to answer
  - If question was not solved, you ask the same question for the next participiant
  - If correct answer is given, next participiant will have a new question
  - There is 5 rounds (so, each participiant will have 5 questions)
